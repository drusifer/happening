## [2026-02-27] Flutter Snap Hijacks LLVM PATH — Cannot Be Fixed With PATH Override

> **Tags:** #Build #Linux #Flutter #LLVM #Neo

### Context
Sprint 2 Linux build via `make run` failed immediately after adding `flutter_secure_storage`.

### The Issue
Flutter snap's `env.sh` unconditionally prepends `/snap/flutter/150/usr/bin` to `$PATH` at startup. `flutter_tools` runs `which clang++`, resolves symlinks, then looks for `ld.lld` in the *same directory* as the resolved binary — which ends up being `/snap/flutter/150/usr/lib/llvm-10/bin/` (no linker there). Prepending system LLVM 20 to PATH in the Makefile has no effect because the snap re-prepends its own dirs first.

### The Solution
Removed the Flutter snap entirely (`sudo snap remove flutter`) and reinstalled via `git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable ~/flutter`. For ARM64 (aarch64/Snapdragon X1E) there is no pre-built tarball — git clone is the correct install method.

### The Rule
**NEVER install Flutter via snap on Linux for desktop development.** Use git clone from the stable branch. The snap bundles LLVM 10 without a linker and its PATH injection cannot be overridden.

## [2026-02-27] google_sign_in Has No Linux Desktop Implementation

> **Tags:** #Auth #Linux #Flutter #GoogleSignIn #Neo

### Context
After switching from snap to git Flutter, `make run` succeeded but clicking the sign-in strip threw `MissingPluginException` for `google_sign_in`.

### The Issue
The `google_sign_in` package supports Android, iOS, and Web only. It has no platform channel implementation for Linux desktop. The exception fires at runtime on first use.

### The Solution
Replaced `google_sign_in` (and `extension_google_sign_in_as_googleapis_auth`) with `googleapis_auth: ^2.0.0` + `url_launcher: ^6.2.0`. Used `clientViaUserConsent()` which starts a local loopback HTTP server, opens the browser for consent, and captures the auth code automatically.

### The Rule
**NEVER use `google_sign_in` for Linux desktop.** Use `googleapis_auth`'s `clientViaUserConsent` (loopback redirect flow) instead. Store client credentials in `assets/client_secret.json` (gitignored).

## [2026-02-27] flutter_secure_storage_linux Bundles Old nlohmann/json — Breaks LLVM 20

> **Tags:** #Build #Linux #LLVM #Dependencies #Neo

### Context
After reinstalling Flutter from git, build failed with `-Werror,-Wdeprecated-literal-operator` inside `json.hpp`.

### The Issue
`flutter_secure_storage_linux 1.2.3` bundles an old version of nlohmann/json that uses the deprecated C++ literal operator syntax (`_json`). LLVM 20 compiles with `-Werror` and rejects it.

### The Solution
Removed `flutter_secure_storage` from `pubspec.yaml` entirely. The `TokenStore` abstract class stays (for future use); the concrete `FlutterSecureTokenStore` implementation was removed. Token persistence deferred to Sprint 3.

### The Rule
**Do NOT add `flutter_secure_storage` until upstream ships a version with json.hpp compatible with LLVM 20.** Track as S3-token. Use in-memory or file-based token storage as a temporary workaround.

## [2026-02-27] Window Height: Use Logical Pixels, Not `30.0 / dpr`

> **Tags:** #WindowManager #Linux #GTK #DPI #Neo

### Context
After reinstalling Flutter (snap → git), the window height was too tall again despite the BUG-03 fix (`30.0 / dpr`).

### The Issue
The BUG-03 fix assumed window_manager required physical pixels and pre-divided by DPR. With non-snap Flutter + proper GTK integration, `window_manager` takes **logical pixels** and GTK applies the system scale factor internally. Passing `30.0 / dpr` double-compensates and produces a window that is too short or too tall depending on the scale factor.

### The Solution
Changed `logicalHeight = 30.0 / dpr` → `logicalHeight = _kStripHeightLogical` (30.0). Let window_manager + GTK handle DPI.

### The Rule
**On Linux, `window_manager.setSize()` takes logical pixels.** Do not pre-divide by DPR. GTK applies the system scale factor automatically. The DPR division was a workaround for snap Flutter's broken GTK integration.

## [2026-02-27] X11 Strut Requires Explicit libX11 Link in Runner CMakeLists

> **Tags:** #Build #Linux #X11 #CMake #Neo

### Context
Added `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` hint to `my_application.cc` using `XInternAtom` / `XChangeProperty`. Build failed with: `libX11.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line`.

### The Issue
GTK links X11 transitively but the linker (clang++ on arm64) requires all DSOs used directly to be listed explicitly. Using Xlib symbols without declaring the dependency causes a linker error even though `libX11.so` is present on the system.

### The Solution
Added `target_link_libraries(${BINARY_NAME} PRIVATE X11)` to `app/linux/runner/CMakeLists.txt`.

### The Rule
**Any direct use of Xlib symbols (`XInternAtom`, `XChangeProperty`, etc.) requires `target_link_libraries(... PRIVATE X11)` in the runner's CMakeLists.** Do not rely on GTK's transitive X11 dependency.

## [2026-02-27] Google OAuth Test Users Required for Unverified Apps

> **Tags:** #Auth #GoogleOAuth #Setup #Drew

### Context
After successfully opening the Google consent screen, sign-in was blocked with "Access blocked: Happening has not completed the Google verification process."

### The Issue
OAuth apps in "External" testing mode can only be used by accounts explicitly listed as Test Users in the Google Cloud Console OAuth consent screen.

### The Solution
In Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → Test users → Add Gmail address of the user.

### The Rule
**Add test user emails in Cloud Console before testing OAuth.** Unverified apps require explicit test user allowlisting. No app changes needed — this is a Cloud Console configuration step.
