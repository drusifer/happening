# Project Decisions: Happening

This document records the architectural and technical decisions made during the development of Happening.

## TL;DR
Critical fixes for the "fat background" bug on Linux (X11/Wayland) require disabling GTK Header Bars, performing manual DPR-to-logical pixel conversion for `window_manager`, and applying rigid min/max size constraints.

## DEC-001: Linux Window Height Constraint (Wayland/GTK)
**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Status**: Decided
**Authors**: Neo (SWE), Morpheus (Lead)

### Context
The "Timeline Strip" requires a very small window height (e.g. 30px). On Linux desktop (GNOME/Wayland using `GDK_BACKEND=x11`), initial implementation resulted in a "fat background" (~720px tall) despite Flutter-level constraints.

### Decision
To achieve a thin, stable strip height on Linux, we must bypass several OS-level and framework-level defaults:

1.  **Disable GTK Header Bar**: By default, GTK injects a Header Bar into every GtkWindow. These have a minimum height enforced by the system theme. We must force `use_header_bar = FALSE` in `app/linux/runner/my_application.cc`.
2.  **DPR-Aware Logical Sizing**: `window_manager` expects logical pixels. `screen_retriever` on Linux returns physical pixels. We must divide the physical screen width and our desired physical height (e.g. 30px) by the Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) to provide a valid logical size to the window manager.
3.  **Rigid Constraints**: Both `minimumSize` and `maximumSize` in `WindowOptions` (and post-show callbacks) must be set to the target size to prevent the compositor from resetting the window to a default "safe" height.
4.  **C++ Window Floor**: Set `gtk_window_set_default_size` in C++ to a very small value (e.g. 1px or 30px) to ensure the initial window creation doesn't enforce a floor.

### Consequences
-   The window is now correctly sized to 30px.
-   The C++ runner is no longer a "vanilla" Flutter template; it contains platform-specific hacks.
-   `GDK_BACKEND=x11` is required to ensure `alwaysOnTop` and `setPosition` work reliably on modern Wayland compositors.
